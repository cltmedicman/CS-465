## Questions
### Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
- Express Html allows for routing on the server side and allows for dynamically rendering HTML using variables.
- Javascript is what Express is written in and allows for the programmer to tell express how to render the content on the webpages.
- A single page application allows for the main HTML page to remain unchange while small amounts of data on the page are changeable with the least amount of data transfer needed. No re-rendering of webpages or loading of new webpages is needed.
### Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
- MongoDB was used because data is stored in JSON format making it easier to access using get, put, post, delete commands. This format is what the internet is uesed to using and allows for easy API calls.
### How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
- JSON is a format in which data is stored and rendered. Whereas Javascript is a programming language that allows for manipulation of that data.
### Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
- Methods are the methods used to retrieve, add, update, and delete data. The methods we used are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Endpoints are the ends of the communication channel. When you send a request, one endpoint is the sending location, whereas the other endpoint would be the database the data is located in.
- Security is necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the data being sent and received. Without security, the data can be intercepted and manipulated.
### How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
- This course is very helpful in the field of Computer Science. Most all programming is being done through the internet nowadays. Going by the wayside are the days of making a standalone application on a device.
- The applications are becomming single page web applications. This allows for easier updating of data and user interface with less updating of the application locally.
